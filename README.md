# SOLID

Basic examples of SOLID principles usage in Ruby.

## [Single responsibility principle](s.rb)

Every class should have a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

## [Open/closed principle](o.rb)

One software entity (class/module) must be open for extension but closed for modification.

## [Liskov substitution principle](l.rb)

If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, etc.).

## [Interface segregation principle](i.rb)

Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces(methods) that they do notÂ use.

## [Dependency inversion principle](d.rb)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
